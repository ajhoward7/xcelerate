PREFERENCES:
- type of race: 5K, 10K, HM, M
- training days per week: 1 - 7
- runner level: Beginner vs Intermediate

CALCULATE:
- number of runs before race
- calculate the FACTOR to get TARGET MPW

NOTES ON THE IDEA SO FAR:
- 8 Vectors: 4 races x 2 runner levels
- Based on the number of runs before race, we select a starting point on the vector and scale

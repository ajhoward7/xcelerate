Introduction
============

Xcelerate is a training app that where users can interact with personalized, dynamically-generated training plans
that focus towards an upcoming race, such as a marathon or a 10k.  The goals of this app are two-fold: the interface
and scheduled training will provide a key source of motivation, while the flexible training plans will update as users
meet, don't meet, or exceed their suggested training.
